  "description": "If youâ€™re a Mexican food lover, combining tomatoes and avocado may be a no-brainer. The good news is that the healthy fat in avocados is believed to help the body absorb more lycopene, the antioxidant compound that gives red, orange and yellow produce its hue. Research from Ohio State University found that when avocado was added to salsa, people absorbed more than four times the amount of lycopene than from salsa without avocado. What makes this pair a winning combo? Increased consumption of lycopene plays a role in the cancer prevention, inflammatory diseases, and age-related illnesses such as cataracts. ",
